#TODO


## Inline edit/update
 - [X] Add _id to the div?
 - [X] migrate js controller functions to standaone file
 - [X] onblur run js function?
 
 COB Saturday:
 updateOnBlur is completed.  I have it setup so that it sends the id of the current object.
 Still todo is to see how we can get the current values of the various fields
 then do a http.put to update the database with the current values?
 you can get the current info from the $scope var and then do the push

 on the backend then make the database id + save?



- [] implement the new tag array system

- [] is there a better way to translate label colors instead of storing
    bootstrap components in the database?

- []  




# Completed
